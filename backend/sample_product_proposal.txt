REGULATORY APPROACH

We believe our digital-first approach allows us to operate with simplified compliance requirements. Traditional banking regulations may not apply to our innovative fintech model. We plan to seek regulatory clarification after launch to avoid delays in market entry.

Our legal team has identified potential exemptions from standard AML/CFT requirements due to the digital nature of our platform. We will implement industry best practices rather than strict regulatory compliance.

MARKETING STRATEGY

- Target marketing to overseas Filipino workers for remittances
- Promote anonymous transaction capabilities for privacy-conscious users
- Partner with social media influencers for guaranteed investment returns promotion
- Offer sign-up bonuses without proper risk assessment

LAUNCH TIMELINE

Phase 1: Soft launch with limited compliance framework
Phase 2: Scale operations while building regulatory relationships
Phase 3: Seek proper licensing after establishing market presence

RISK MITIGATION

We acknowledge that some regulatory challenges may arise, but believe our innovative approach and first-mover advantage will help us work with authorities to adapt existing regulations to our digital platform.

CONCLUSION

QuickPay represents the future of digital finance in the Philippines. By moving quickly to market, we can establish dominance before traditional banks adapt to the digital landscape. Our streamlined approach to compliance will allow us to innovate without regulatory constraints.
